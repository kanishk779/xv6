* Each process consists of user-space memory - instructions, data and stack and
	per process state private to the kernel
* When a process is not running, xv6 saves it CPU registers and restores them
	when it next runs
* All xv6 processes run as root
# I/O and File descriptors
* A file descriptor is a small integer representing a kernel-managed object that
	a process may read from or write to - it may be an open file, directory,
	device etc
# Pipes
* A pipe is a small kernel buffer exposed to process as a pair of file
	descriptors, one for reading and one for writing
